Test pixel constraints:
    Test the function pixel_constraints with diffrent edgecases and other values.
        - Checks the code with 255 as high and 0 as low values, values inannför intervallet
        - Checks the code with 255 as high and 0 as low values. Values inannför intervallet.
        - Checks the code with 255 as high and 255 as low values. Values utanför intervallet
        - Checks the code with 0 as high and 0 as low values. Values utanför intervallet
        - Checks the code with 200 as high and 100 as low values. Values utanför intervallet
        - Checks the code with a string instead of a tuple.

Test Generator From Image
    Tests the function generator_from_image if its able to retrive
    elements in a list from functionscalls.
        -Checks the code with different data and indexes
        -Checks the code with strings as indexes and empty funcioncalls.

Test combines Images
    Tests the function combine_images by checking if it catches an error
    message if the lists that it uses are diffrent lenghts, and if it works
    if it should work.

        -The function gets the correct arguments. Same size list.
        -The function gets the incorrect arguments. Diffrent size list.
